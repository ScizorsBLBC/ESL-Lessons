## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns & Development Rules

### **Core Principles**

#### **1. Data-Driven Design (Principle 1 & 2)**
- **Content Separation**: NEVER hard-code lesson content (titles, text, quiz questions) inside components
- **Schema Compliance**: NEVER modify, add to, or remove properties from canonical schema structures
- **Service Usage**: When processing data, ALWAYS utilize existing functions from `src/services/`

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Import data from dedicated files
import { vocabularyData } from '../data/vocabularyData.js';
const lessonContent = vocabularyData.content;

// ‚ùå INCORRECT: Hard-coded content in components
const lessonContent = [
  { type: 'text', data: { htmlContent: '<h2>Hard-coded content</h2>' } }
];
```

#### **2. Component Composition (Principle 3)**
- **Reusable Components**: Before writing new UI components, ALWAYS check for and utilize existing modular components
- **Core Renderers**: Use `ContentBlockRenderer` and `ContentSelector` as primary tools for displaying data-driven content

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use existing components
<ContentBlockRenderer content={lessonData.content} />

// ‚ùå INCORRECT: Custom rendering logic
{content.map(block => {
  switch (block.type) {
    case 'text': return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: block.data.htmlContent }} />;
    // Don't reimplement existing component logic
  }
})}
```

#### **3. Styling Consistency (Principle 4)**
- **MUI sx Prop Only**: NEVER use inline `style` attributes or hardcoded CSS values
- **Theme Colors**: ALWAYS use theme color references (e.g., `'primary.main'`, `'text.secondary'`)
- **GlassButtonWrapper**: ALWAYS wrap interactive elements with GlassButtonWrapper

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Theme-aware styling
sx={{
  color: 'primary.main',
  bgcolor: 'background.paper',
  borderColor: 'divider'
}}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Interactive element wrapping
<GlassButtonWrapper>
  <Button onClick={handleClick}>Action</Button>
</GlassButtonWrapper>

// ‚ùå INCORRECT: Hardcoded colors or direct buttons
<Button style={{ color: '#ff0000' }} onClick={handleClick}>Action</Button>
```

#### **4. Responsive Design**
- **Mobile-First**: ALWAYS use responsive syntax (`sx={{ p: { xs: 2, sm: 3 } }}`)
- **Touch Targets**: ALWAYS ensure 44px minimum touch targets for accessibility

### **Component Architecture**

#### **Standardized Prop Interface**
All components follow this consistent pattern:
```javascript
const ComponentName = ({ data, accessibility }) => {
  // Component logic using data.title, data.content, etc.
};
```

#### **Data Structure Expectations**

| Component | Data Structure | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `Quiz` | `{ title, questions[] }` | `{ title: "Quiz Title", questions: [{ question, answers, correctAnswer }] }` |
| `Flashcard` | `{ title, cards[] }` | `{ title: "Flashcards", cards: [{ front, back }] }` |
| `ChartSection` | `{ title, chartType, labels[], datasets[] }` | `{ title: "Chart", chartType: "bar", labels: ["A", "B"], datasets: [{ data: [1, 2] }] }` |

#### **Styling Utilities**
Use established utility functions for consistent styling:
```javascript
import { createLessonCard, createLessonTitle } from '../utils/stylingUtils';

<Paper sx={createLessonCard('primary.main')}>
  <Typography sx={createLessonTitle('primary.dark')}>
    Lesson Title
  </Typography>
</Paper>
```

### **Adding New Components**

1. **Check Existing First**
   ```javascript
   // ‚úÖ Use existing components when possible
   import ContentBlockRenderer from '../components/ContentBlockRenderer';
   <ContentBlockRenderer content={lessonData.content} />;
   ```

2. **Follow Prop Interface**
   ```javascript
   // ‚úÖ Consistent prop interface
   const NewComponent = ({ data, accessibility }) => {
     const { title, content } = data;
   };
   ```

3. **Use Styling Utilities**
   ```javascript
   // ‚úÖ Use established styling patterns
   <Paper sx={createLessonCard('primary.main')}>
     <Typography sx={createLessonTitle('primary.dark')}>
       Content
     </Typography>
   </Paper>
   ```

### üîß Development Tools

#### Article Manager (CRUD System)
The Article Manager is a comprehensive development-only GUI tool for creating and editing news articles with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. This tool is only accessible in development mode and provides a complete interface for managing the news article database.

**Key Features:**
- **Dual-Mode Interface**: Toggle between "Create Article" and "Edit Existing" modes
- **Real-Time Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all article fields with immediate feedback
- **Auto-Save Functionality**: Changes are automatically saved to the local `newsData.js` file
- **Topic Integration**: Automatic categorization with visual topic selection
- **Multi-Level Content Support**: Separate content sections for Level 1, 3, and 6 difficulty levels
- **Rich Text Support**: Multi-line text areas for article content and questions
- **Date Management**: Built-in date picker for article publication dates
- **Slug Generation**: URL-friendly slug field with validation hints
- **Image URL Support**: Optional image URL field for article thumbnails
- **Alphabetized Article Selection**: Edit mode dropdown sorted alphabetically by article headlines for easy navigation

**How It Works:**
1. **Article Structure**: Each article contains multiple difficulty levels (1, 3, 6) with separate text content, comprehension questions, and instructions
2. **File-Based Storage**: Articles are stored in `src/data/newsData.js` as JavaScript objects
3. **Topic Mapping**: Article topics are automatically synced with `src/data/articleTopics.js`
4. **Validation System**: Comprehensive validation ensures data integrity before saving
5. **Immediate Feedback**: Visual success/error messages with detailed status information

**Usage:**
1. **Access**: Only available in development mode (`isDevelopment()` returns true). First start both development servers (see Development Setup section below), then access the Article Manager through the application interface.
2. **Create Mode**: Fill out all required fields and click "Create Article"
3. **Edit Mode**: Select an existing article from the dropdown, modify fields, and click "Update Article"
4. **Validation**: The system validates all fields before saving and provides detailed error messages
5. **Persistence**: Changes are written directly to the local file system for immediate effect

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend Component**: `src/components/ArticleManager.jsx` - Main GUI interface
- **Backend API**: `server/server.js` - Handles file I/O operations for CRUD operations
- **Data Validation**: `src/utils/fileWriter.js` - Comprehensive validation logic
- **Topic Management**: `src/data/articleTopics.js` - Topic categorization system
- **Service Integration**: `src/services/api.js` - API communication layer

**Security & Development-Only Access:**
- **Origin Validation**: Only accepts requests from `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
- **Environment Check**: Blocked in production environments for security
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### üé® Advanced Theming System
- **5 Distinct Themes**: Light, Dark, Vaporwave, Monochrome Light, and Monochrome Dark.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Beautiful backdrop blur effects and transparency.
- **Animated Backgrounds**: Subtle film grain and gradient animations.
- **Theme Persistence**: Remembers user preference across sessions.

### üîí Security & Performance
- **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)**: Secure API key management for translation services using serverless functions.
- **Optimized Builds**: Vite provides a highly optimized and small production bundle for fast loading.
- **Secure Headers**: Deployed with security headers like X-Frame-Options and Referrer-Policy for user protection.

### üöÄ Deployment Configuration
- **Vite Base Path**: Configured with absolute paths (`base: '/'`) for correct asset loading on all routes.
- **Netlify SPA Deployment**: Uses a single catch-all redirect rule (`/*` ‚Üí `/index.html`) for optimal single-page application routing.
- **Dynamic Route Support**: Properly handles nested routes like `/vocabulary/1` and `/idioms/12` without asset loading issues.
- **Serverless Functions**: API routes are handled by Netlify Functions located in the `server/` directory.

   ```bash
   # Create a new feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/new-lesson-component

   # Make your changes and test locally
   npm run dev

   # Does the README.md need to be updated with these changes?

   # Stage and commit your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new lesson component with glassmorphism styling"
   ```

2. **Pull Request Creation**:
   ```bash
   # Push your feature branch to GitHub
   git push origin feature/new-lesson-component

   # Create a pull request on GitHub
   # Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   # Click "Compare & pull request"
   # Add a descriptive title and description
   # Request review from maintainers
   ```

3. **Post-Merge Cleanup & Branch Management**:
   **Critical Step**: Always perform these cleanup steps after your pull request is successfully merged to prevent branch clutter and ensure you're working with the latest code.

   ```bash
   # Step 1: Verify the merge was successful on GitHub
   # - Go to your repository on GitHub
   # - Confirm the pull request shows "Merged"
   # - Check that the deployment completed successfully

   # Step 2: Delete the remote branch on GitHub
   # Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   # Click on "Branches" in the left sidebar
   # Find your feature branch (e.g., "feature/new-lesson-component")
   # Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) to delete the branch
   # Confirm deletion when prompted

   # Step 3: Switch to main branch locally
   git checkout main

   # Step 4: Pull the latest changes to ensure you have everything
   git pull origin main

   # Step 5: Verify you have the latest code
   git log --oneline -5  # Shows last 5 commits
   git status             # Should show "On branch main" with no changes
   ```
   **Safety Verification Steps**:
   ```bash
   # Step 6: Before deleting your branch, verify:
   git branch -a                    # List all branches (local and remote)
   git log main..feature/your-branch # Shows commits only on your branch
   git diff main..feature/your-branch # Shows all changes on your branch
   ```

   ```bash
   # Step 7: Delete your local feature branch
   git branch -d feature/new-lesson-component

   # Step 8: Clean up any untracked files if needed
   git clean -fd  # Only if you're sure (removes untracked files/directories)
   ```

   **Important Notes**:
   - **Never delete branches with uncommitted work** - commit or stash first
   - **Double-check GitHub deletion** - ensure you're deleting the right branch
   - **Wait for deployment** - confirm Netlify build completes before cleanup
   - **Check for conflicts** - if merge had conflicts, ensure they're resolved

   **Troubleshooting**:
   ```bash
   # If git pull fails due to conflicts:
   git status                    # See what's conflicting
   git diff                      # View the conflicts
   # Resolve conflicts manually, then:
   git add .                     # Stage resolved files
   git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"

   # If you accidentally delete a branch with work:
   git reflog                    # Shows recent branch history
   git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>  # Recover from reflog
   ```

- Added comprehensive pattern enforcement and documentation

The ESL Lessons Hub now provides a world-class, accessible learning experience that works flawlessly across all devices while maintaining the signature glassmorphism aesthetic that makes it visually distinctive and engaging for ESL learners.

## Core Architectural Principles

This project follows a strict set of principles to ensure it remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to contribute to.

1.  **Data-Driven Content**: All lesson content (text, chart data, video links, etc.) is strictly separated from the UI components. All content resides in dedicated JavaScript files within the `src/data/` directory. UI components are designed to be stateless "templates" that simply render the data imported from this directory.

2.  **Modular & Reusable Components**: The application is built on a foundation of custom, reusable components located in `src/components/`. New features and lessons should leverage these existing components to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.

3.  **No Student-Facing Navigation**: The platform is designed as a collection of individual lessons accessed via direct links. There is no global navigation bar or central lesson index for students, ensuring a focused learning experience for each topic.

## Available Lessons

The ESL Lessons Hub includes comprehensive lessons covering essential English language topics:

### üìö Core Grammar Lessons
- **English Verb Tenses**: Complete coverage of present, past, and future tenses with interactive quizzes
- **English Prepositions**: Interactive quizzes for place, time, and movement prepositions with immediate feedback

### üìñ Vocabulary & Communication

- **Idioms & Expressions**: Common English idioms with usage examples and practice exercises
- **Phrasal Verbs**: Essential phrasal verbs with interactive exercises and real-world contexts

### üåç Cultural & Practical Studies
- **Global Business Cultures**: Professional communication across cultures
- **Cat Culture Studies**: Fun, engaging lessons about feline behavior and culture
- **News Article Analysis**: Critical reading and vocabulary building through current events

### üîä Pronunciation & Language Skills
- **Pronunciation Guide**: Interactive pronunciation lessons with audio support
- **Sound Recognition**: Practice distinguishing English sounds and intonation patterns

Each lesson includes interactive exercises, quizzes, and multimedia content designed to maximize learning retention and engagement.

## Content Schema Guide

The lesson schema is designed for maximum flexibility while maintaining the strict separation of content and presentation.

#### Basic Structure
```javascript
// Basic content block structure:
{
  "blockId": "unique-identifier-with-semantic-meaning",  // e.g., "present-tenses-quiz-09"
  "type": "content-type-identifier",                     // e.g., "text", "quiz", "chart"
  "data": {
    // Content-specific structure varies by type
  }
}
```
