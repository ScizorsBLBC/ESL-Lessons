# ‚úÇÔ∏è ESL Lessons Hub

Welcome to Scizors' ESL Lessons Hub, a modern, interactive web application designed to host a collection of dynamic and engaging lessons for ESL students. This project was bootstrapped with Vite and is built on a robust, mobile-first React foundation, utilizing Material-UI for a beautiful, responsive user interface.

# üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture & Vision

This repository is structured to grow into a multi-lesson platform. The goal is to create a hub where various educational modules can be easily added and accessed as new, interactive pages. The core architecture is designed to be modular:

- **Main App Shell (`App.jsx`):** Provides the consistent layout, theme-switching logic, and routing for the entire platform.
- **Lesson Components:** Each lesson is a self-contained set of React components located in `src/pages/lessons/`.
- **Data Modules (`/src/data`):** Lesson-specific content (text, chart data, etc.) is kept in separate JavaScript files to keep the component logic clean and maintainable.
- **Secure Serverless Backend:** To protect sensitive credentials, the application uses a Netlify serverless function as a proxy for all Airtable API calls. The frontend application makes requests to a local API endpoint (`/api/airtable`), and the serverless function securely adds the API token on the server before fetching data from Airtable.

# üé® Aesthetic & Theming

The visual identity of this platform is a core feature, designed to be both elegant and engaging. The aesthetic is inspired by Scizors' figurative fashion concept art. Inspired by iconic artwork from vintage fashion editorials, these themes blend vibrant colors with a sense of motion and texture.

Key visual elements include:

- **Glassmorphism:** A "liquid glass" effect is applied to all card and paper surfaces, creating a sense of depth and modernity.
- **Animated Film Grain:** A subtle, animated texture is layered over the entire interface to emulate the organic feel of vintage film and eliminate digital color banding.
- **Five Curated Themes:** The application features a palette of five distinct themes, allowing users to customize their experience:
    - Dark & Light: Sophisticated, high-contrast themes for classic readability.
    - VaporWave Mode: An expressive theme that directly mirrors the colors of the inspirational artwork with a 90's.
    - Monochrome Dark & Light: Chic, Bauhaus-inspired themes that focus on form and structure.

# üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Getting Started & Development

1.  **Initial Setup**
    Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies from your terminal.

    `npm install`

2.  **Running the Development Server**
    This project uses the Netlify CLI to accurately simulate the production environment, running both the Vite frontend and the serverless functions locally.

    `npm run dev`

# üåê Deployment Workflow

This site is deployed to **Netlify** and served from the custom domain:

`https://esl-lessons.scizors.wtf`

Netlify is connected directly to the GitHub repository. A new deployment is **automatically triggered** every time changes are merged into the `main` branch. The recommended workflow is as follows:

1.  **Create a New Branch**
    First, ensure your local `main` branch is up-to-date, then create your new feature branch.

    `git checkout main`
    `git pull`
    `git checkout -b new-feature-branch`

2.  **Make Your Code Changes**
    Add new lessons, fix bugs, or update styles. Test your work locally using `npm run dev`.

3.  **Commit Your Changes**
    Stage and commit your work with a clear, descriptive message.

    `git add .`
    `git commit -m "feat: Add new awesome feature"`

4.  **Push Your Branch to GitHub**
    Push your feature branch to the remote repository.

    `git push origin new-feature-branch`

5.  **Open and Merge a Pull Request on GitHub**
    Go to your repository on GitHub. You'll see a prompt to `Compare & pull request` for your new branch. Open a pull request, have it reviewed, and then **merge it into `main`**.

    Merging into `main` will automatically start the deployment process on Netlify. Changes are typically live within 1-3 minutes.
