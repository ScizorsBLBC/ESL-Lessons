## Core Architectural Principles

This project follows a strict set of principles to ensure it remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to contribute to.

1.  **Data-Driven Content**: All lesson content (text, chart data, video links, etc.) is strictly separated from the UI components. All content resides in dedicated JavaScript files within the `src/data/` directory. UI components are designed to be stateless "templates" that simply render the data imported from this directory.

2.  **Modular & Reusable Components**: The application is built on a foundation of custom, reusable components located in `src/components/`. New features and lessons should leverage these existing components to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.

3.  **No Student-Facing Navigation**: The platform is designed as a collection of individual lessons accessed via direct links. There is no global navigation bar or central lesson index for students, ensuring a focused learning experience for each topic.

## Content Schema Guide

The lesson schema is designed for maximum flexibility while maintaining the strict separation of content and presentation.

#### Basic Structure
```javascript
// Basic content block structure:
{
  "blockId": "unique-identifier-with-semantic-meaning",  // e.g., "present-tenses-quiz-09"
  "type": "content-type-identifier",                     // e.g., "text", "quiz", "chart"
  "data": {
    // Content-specific structure varies by type
  }
}
```

## Recent Fixes & Updates

### Modular Component Opportunities

#### Reusable Components for Future Lessons
The enhancements implemented in the Phrasal Verbs lesson demonstrate several patterns that can be abstracted into reusable components:

1. **Responsive Content Layout (`TwoPaneLayout`)**:
   - **Current Use**: Introduction section with definition and examples
   - **Future Applications**: Any lesson needing side-by-side content (theory + examples, vocabulary + usage, etc.)
   - **Benefits**: Mobile-first responsive design, consistent spacing, accessibility-friendly

2. **Dynamic Quiz Generation**:
   - **Current Use**: Gap fill exercises with random question selection
   - **Future Applications**: Any lesson requiring randomized question sets
   - **Benefits**: Reduces repetition, increases engagement, maintains consistent question structure

3. **Enhanced Text-to-Speech Integration**:
   - **Current Use**: Clean text formatting with proper line breaks
   - **Future Applications**: All lessons with audio content
   - **Benefits**: Better accessibility, improved learning experience, consistent audio quality

4. **Vocabulary Organization System**:
   - **Current Use**: 10 topic-based phrasal verb categories
   - **Future Applications**: Any lesson with categorized vocabulary (verbs, idioms, business terms, etc.)
   - **Benefits**: Scalable organization, easy content management, improved user navigation

#### Implementation Patterns for Future Lessons
- **Data Structure**: Topic-based organization with consistent schema compliance
- **Component Reusability**: Leverage existing `TwoPaneLayout`, `Quiz`, `Flashcard` components
- **Content Filtering**: Extend `getFilteredContent()` pattern for new lesson types
- **Responsive Design**: Apply TwoPaneLayout pattern for mobile-first layouts

#### Vocabulary-Driven Exercise Generation
The Phrasal Verbs lesson demonstrates a powerful pattern for automatically generating interactive exercises from vocabulary data:

1. **Vocabulary Parsing Engine**:
   - **Pattern Matching**: Extracts phrasal verb-definition pairs using regex patterns like `<strong>Verb</strong> ‚Äì Definition`
   - **HTML Processing**: Strips formatting tags while preserving semantic content
   - **Data Normalization**: Converts extracted data into consistent flashcard/quiz formats

2. **Automated Flashcard Generation**:
   - **Source**: Any content block with vocabulary definitions
   - **Format**: `{front: "Phrasal Verb", back: "Definition\n\nExample: 'Example sentence.'"}`
   - **Benefits**: Instant flashcard collection without manual creation

3. **Dynamic Quiz Generation**:
   - **Question Types**: Multiple choice with randomized distractors
   - **Source Material**: Vocabulary definitions as answer options
   - **Randomization**: Ensures unique question sets per session
   - **Scalability**: Works with any size vocabulary database

4. **Gap Fill Exercise Creation**:
   - **Source**: Sentence templates with vocabulary integration
   - **Random Selection**: 20 questions from available exercises
   - **Progressive Difficulty**: Can be extended with complexity tiers

#### Abstraction Opportunities for Future Lessons
This vocabulary-driven approach can be abstracted into reusable services:

```javascript
// Potential service architecture
const VocabularyExerciseService = {
  parseVocabulary(contentBlocks) {
    // Extract verb-definition pairs from any content
    return extractedVocabulary;
  },

  generateFlashcards(vocabularyData) {
    // Convert vocabulary to flashcard format
    return flashcardArray;
  },

  generateQuiz(vocabularyData, questionCount = 20) {
    // Create randomized quiz questions
    return quizQuestions;
  },

  generateGapFill(sentences, vocabularyData) {
    // Create gap fill exercises
    return exerciseArray;
  }
};
```

**Benefits for Future Lessons**:
- **Automatic Exercise Generation**: Any lesson with vocabulary data gets flashcards, quizzes, and gap fill exercises
- **Consistent Quality**: Standardized question formats and difficulty levels
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Single data source drives multiple exercise types
- **Scalability**: Works with vocabulary databases of any size
- **Localization Ready**: Can be extended for multiple languages

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Data Schema**: Ensure vocabulary content follows consistent `<strong>Term</strong> ‚Äì Definition` pattern
2. **Service Layer**: Abstract parsing and generation logic into reusable utilities
3. **Component Integration**: Update existing components to accept generated exercise data
4. **Configuration**: Allow lessons to specify exercise parameters (question count, difficulty, etc.)
