# ESL Lessons Hub

Welcome to the ESL Lessons Hub, a modern, schema-driven platform designed to function as a premier Cognitive Learning Environment. Our goal is to evolve beyond a simple content repository by integrating pedagogically-driven, interactive components that reduce cognitive load and empower learners to build robust mental models of complex English concepts.

## Core Architectural Principles

This project follows a strict set of principles to ensure it remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to contribute to.

1.  **Data-Driven Content**: All lesson content (text, chart data, video links, etc.) is strictly separated from the UI components. All content resides in dedicated JavaScript files within the `src/data/` directory. UI components are designed to be stateless "templates" that simply render the data imported from this directory.

2.  **Modular & Reusable Components**: The application is built on a foundation of custom, reusable components located in `src/components/`. New features and lessons should leverage these existing components to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.

3.  **No Student-Facing Navigation**: The platform is designed as a collection of individual lessons accessed via direct links. There is no global navigation bar or central lesson index for students, ensuring a focused learning experience for each topic.

## Content Schema Guide

The lesson schema is designed for maximum flexibility while maintaining the strict separation of content and presentation.

#### Basic Structure
```javascript
// Basic content block structure:
{
  "blockId": "unique-identifier-with-semantic-meaning",  // e.g., "present-tenses-quiz-09"
  "type": "content-type-identifier",                     // e.g., "text", "quiz", "chart"
  "data": {
    // Content-specific structure varies by type
  }
}
```

## Recent Fixes & Updates

### Phrasal Verbs Content Filtering Fix
- **Issue**: Phrasal Verbs lesson content was not displaying properly due to missing tab-based filtering logic
- **Fix**: Added `getFilteredContent()` function to properly filter content blocks based on active tab selection
- **Tabs**:
  - **Introduction**: Shows intro-* content blocks (phrasal verb definitions and examples)
  - **Workplace Verbs**: Shows workplace-* content blocks (professional communication verbs)
  - **Full Vocabulary**: Shows all vocabulary category blocks (communication, socializing, business, travel, etc.)
  - **Practice & Assess**: Shows assessment-* and practice blocks (quizzes, flashcards, homework)
- **Impact**: Users can now properly navigate through different sections of the Phrasal Verbs lesson with tab-based content filtering

## Recent Enhancements

### Comprehensive Phrasal Verbs Lesson Overhaul
- **Added 100+ Phrasal Verbs**: Organized into 10 topic categories (Communication, Socializing, Work & Business, Travel, Starting/Stopping, Thinking, Problems, Daily Life, Finance, Progress & General)
- **Enhanced Flashcard System**: Now supports 100+ phrasal verbs with proper HTML tag stripping and clean text formatting
- **Responsive Introduction Layout**: Implemented TwoPaneLayout for mobile-first responsive design (side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- **Gap Fill Exercise System**: 21 randomly selected questions with proper navigation and scoring
- **Fixed Section Mapping**: Corrected homework assignment and contextual practice section content loading
- **Improved Text-to-Speech**: Enhanced formatting with proper line breaks and example sentence separation

### Modular Component Opportunities

#### Reusable Components for Future Lessons
The enhancements implemented in the Phrasal Verbs lesson demonstrate several patterns that can be abstracted into reusable components:

1. **Responsive Content Layout (`TwoPaneLayout`)**:
   - **Current Use**: Introduction section with definition and examples
   - **Future Applications**: Any lesson needing side-by-side content (theory + examples, vocabulary + usage, etc.)
   - **Benefits**: Mobile-first responsive design, consistent spacing, accessibility-friendly

2. **Dynamic Quiz Generation**:
   - **Current Use**: Gap fill exercises with random question selection
   - **Future Applications**: Any lesson requiring randomized question sets
   - **Benefits**: Reduces repetition, increases engagement, maintains consistent question structure

3. **Enhanced Text-to-Speech Integration**:
   - **Current Use**: Clean text formatting with proper line breaks
   - **Future Applications**: All lessons with audio content
   - **Benefits**: Better accessibility, improved learning experience, consistent audio quality

4. **Vocabulary Organization System**:
   - **Current Use**: 10 topic-based phrasal verb categories
   - **Future Applications**: Any lesson with categorized vocabulary (verbs, idioms, business terms, etc.)
   - **Benefits**: Scalable organization, easy content management, improved user navigation

#### Implementation Patterns for Future Lessons
- **Data Structure**: Topic-based organization with consistent schema compliance
- **Component Reusability**: Leverage existing `TwoPaneLayout`, `Quiz`, `Flashcard` components
- **Content Filtering**: Extend `getFilteredContent()` pattern for new lesson types
- **Responsive Design**: Apply TwoPaneLayout pattern for mobile-first layouts
