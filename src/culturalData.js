        { name: 'Japan', score: 10, details: "<strong>Japan (High-Context):</strong> The apex of high-context. Meaning is conveyed through shared context, non-verbal cues (a long pause, a sharp intake of breath), and what is *not* said. This is the world of *honne* (one's true feelings) and *tatemae* (the public face or opinion). You will almost always be shown the *tatemae*. Maintaining group harmony (*wa* 和) is the primary goal. Saying 'no' directly is considered disruptive and impolite; instead, phrases like 'I will take it into consideration' (*kentou shimasu*) or 'That is a bit difficult' (*sore wa chotto musukashii desu*) are used to signal disagreement. 'Reading the air' (*kuuki wo yomu*) is a critical social skill." },
        { name: 'S. Korea', score: 9.5, details: "<strong>S. Korea (High-Context):</strong> Communication is indirect to maintain harmony, heavily influenced by hierarchy. What is unsaid is often the real message. Respect for seniority dictates a formal, deferential style. Direct contradiction of a superior is avoided." },
        { name: 'China', score: 9, details: "<strong>China (High-Context):</strong> High-context, where meaning is layered in metaphors, historical allusions, and proverbs. The concept of 'face' (*miànzi* 面子)—one's reputation, dignity, and social standing—is a critical social currency. You must never cause someone to 'lose face' by criticizing them publicly. Communication style can change drastically depending on whether you are an insider (*nèirén*) or an outsider (*wàirén*) within their network of relationships (*guanxi* 关系). An outsider will receive very formal, indirect communication, while an insider may receive more direct information." },
        { name: 'Nigeria', score: 8.8, details: "<strong>Nigeria (High-Context):</strong> Communication is generally indirect and very respectful of hierarchy and age. Titles are important. The style can be highly expressive and narrative, using proverbs and stories to convey a point. The listener is expected to infer meaning from the context. 'Yes' often means 'I am listening respectfully' rather than 'I agree'." },
        { name: 'India', score: 8.5, details: "<strong>India (High-Context):</strong> High-context and hierarchical. Communication is often indirect to show respect to seniors. A 'yes' can have many meanings, from 'I hear you' to 'I will try my best,' and does not always signify a firm commitment. The characteristic head wobble can signify acknowledgement, understanding, or agreement, and the specific meaning is derived entirely from context. The communication style can also be very persuasive and expressive, using stories and analogies to make a point." },
        { name: 'Middle East', score: 8, details: "<strong>Middle East (High-Context):</strong> Highly relationship-driven and high-context. Language can be expressive, persuasive, and emotionally rich. Business is personal; trust must be established through extensive small talk before direct communication can occur. The concept of saving face for both yourself and your counterpart is critical. A promise may be a statement of intent rather than a binding commitment, contingent on the strength of the relationship." },
        { name: 'Mexico', score: 7.5, details: "<strong>Mexico (High-Context):</strong> Politeness and diplomacy are paramount. Communication is often indirect to maintain relational harmony, and saying 'no' directly can be seen as rude. Instead, more ambiguous phrases like 'we'll see' or 'perhaps' are used. Building personal rapport before discussing business is essential." },
        { name: 'Russia', score: 7, details: "<strong>Russia (Hybrid):</strong> Communication is highly relationship-dependent. With strangers or superiors, it can be formal and indirect. With trusted colleagues, it can become extremely direct and blunt. Passionate, emotional debate is common and not seen as personal." },
        { name: 'Brazil', score: 6.5, details: "<strong>Brazil (Hybrid):</strong> Relationship-focused and expressive. While the topic of conversation can be direct, the *way* it is discussed is highly contextual, fluid, and often passionate. Interrupting is not necessarily rude but can be a sign of enthusiastic engagement. The conversation may wander off-topic as relationship-building is happening concurrently with the business discussion." },
        { name: 'France', score: 6, details: "<strong>France (Hybrid):</strong> A unique hybrid. The French value eloquence, precision, and logic in language (low-context), a concept known as *l'art de la parole* (the art of speaking). However, the interpretation heavily depends on the relationship, social context, and non-verbal cues (high-context). Engaging in vigorous intellectual debate is a way of exploring an idea and showing respect for the other person's intellect; it is not personal conflict." },
        { name: 'UK', score: 5, details: "<strong>UK (Mid-Context):</strong> Mid-context and notoriously difficult to decode. Communication can be direct, but it is often coded in understatement, irony, and sarcasm. 'Not bad' can mean 'very good.' 'With all due respect...' often precedes a strong disagreement. 'I'll bear that in mind' can mean 'I disagree and we will not be doing that.' Politeness and humor are used as tools to soften direct messages or deliver criticism indirectly." },
        { name: 'Australia', score: 4, details: "<strong>Australia (Low-Context):</strong> Direct like the US, but often with more understatement and a greater emphasis on team harmony and politeness. Sarcasm and dry humor are common tools for building rapport, which can be easily misinterpreted. 'No worries' is a common Australian phrase signifying 'you're welcome' or 'it's okay.'" },
        { name: 'USA', score: 3, details: "<strong>USA (Low-Context):</strong> Direct and explicit, but with a cultural emphasis on positive framing, enthusiasm, and providing solutions. Feedback is often given using the 'sandwich method' (praise, criticism, praise). Politeness is shown through friendly and optimistic language ('Great question!', 'I'd be happy to help with that'). The use of idioms and sports metaphors ('let's touch base,' 'hit a home run') is common and can be a barrier for non-native speakers." },
        { name: 'Israel', score: 2.8, details: "<strong>Israel (Low-Context):</strong> Communication is exceptionally direct, blunt, and assertive, a style known as *dugri* (straight talk). Challenging ideas and engaging in passionate debate is seen as a normal and efficient way to reach the best conclusion, not a personal attack. There is little time for politeness that obscures the main point." },
        { name: 'Canada', score: 2.5, details: "<strong>Canada (Low-Context):</strong> Communication is direct and explicit, similar to the US, but often with an even greater emphasis on politeness, diplomacy, and avoiding confrontation. The language may be softer and more understated." },
        { name: 'Scandinavia', score: 2, details: "<strong>Scandinavia (Low-Context):</strong> Direct, but also highly democratic and consensus-oriented. Communication is transparent and honest, as trust is the foundation of business. Open, respectful debate is encouraged, and decisions are made collectively. There is a low tolerance for bragging or overly expressive communication, valuing calmness and practicality. This is captured in the Swedish concept of *lagom* (just the right amount, moderation)." },
        { name: 'Germany', score: 1, details: "<strong>Germany (Low-Context):</strong> The focus is on *truth* and *accuracy* (*Sachlichkeit* - objectivity). Communication is precise, literal, and fact-based, as ambiguity is seen as inefficient and unprofessional. Small talk is minimal because the purpose of a business meeting is business; getting straight to the point is a sign of respect for the other person's time and intelligence. Feedback is direct and targets the issue, not the person. A German might say, 'This report has three factual errors,' which is intended as an objective statement, not a personal attack." },
        { name: 'Netherlands', score: 0.5, details: "<strong>Netherlands (Low-Context):</strong> Often considered one of the most direct cultures. Honesty and transparency are prized above all else, even if it feels blunt. The goal is clarity and efficiency; softening language is seen as potentially confusing or insincere. You will always know where you stand." }

        { name: 'Nigeria', score: 10, details: "<strong>Nigeria (Hierarchical / The Elder Statesman):</strong> Power distance is extremely high. Deep respect is given to age, title, and wealth. Leaders are paternalistic and make decisions for the group. It is considered very disrespectful to challenge a superior publicly. Seniority is the primary basis for authority." },
        { name: 'China', score: 9.8, details: "<strong>China (Hierarchical / The Decisive Leader):</strong> The leader is the ultimate authority and is expected to have the answers and give clear direction.

        { name: 'India', score: 9.5, details: "<strong>India (Hierarchical / The Paternalistic Leader):</strong> The leader is the ultimate, paternalistic authority. Titles are crucial. Publicly challenging a superior is unacceptable. The leader also takes a personal interest in the well-being of their subordinates." },
        { name: 'S. Korea', score: 9, details: "<strong>S. Korea (Hierarchical / The Benevolent Father):</strong> A steep pyramid structure where authority is rooted in age and rank (Confucian philosophy). The leader is seen as a benevolent father figure who makes the final decision, but only after extensive informal consensus-building among the team to ensure harmony. Respect for this structure is absolute." },
        { name: 'Japan', score: 8.5, details: "<strong>Japan (Hierarchical / The Consensus Builder):</strong> While the hierarchy is steep and formal (the boss is the boss), the decision-making process is famously bottom-up. The *Ringi-Seido* involves proposals circulating from mid-management to gain consensus (*nemawashi*) before reaching the top for a final stamp of approval. The leader's role is to facilitate harmony and approve the group's decision, not to be a top-down autocrat." },
        { name: 'Mexico', score: 8.2, details: "<strong>Mexico (Hierarchical / The Patron):</strong> A clear hierarchical structure with a paternalistic leader (*el patrón*) who is expected to be strong, decisive, and caring toward their subordinates. In return, employees show loyalty and deference. Titles are very important and should always be used." },
        { name: 'Russia', score: 8, details: "<strong>Russia (Hierarchical / The Strong Leader):</strong> A strong, centralized leadership model is common, rooted in a history of centralized power. The leader is the ultimate decision-maker, and their authority is rarely challenged openly. Subordinates expect clear, direct instructions." },
        { name: 'France', score: 7, details: "<strong>France (Hierarchical / The Expert Leader):</strong> The leader is an expert and a figure of authority (*le patron*). They are respected for their intellect and are expected to have a strong, clear vision. Decisions are made at the top and are expected to be carried out." },
        { name: 'Brazil', score: 6.5, details: "<strong>Brazil (Hierarchical):</strong> Power is often concentrated in the hands of senior leaders who act as patrons. Subordinates show deference and loyalty, and in return, the leader provides guidance and protection. Titles are important." },
        { name: 'Middle East', score: 6, details: "<strong>Middle East (Hierarchical):</strong> Power is held by senior, often older, leaders. Decisions are made at the top, and respect for authority is paramount. Family connections can also play a significant role in business hierarchy." },
        { name: 'USA', score: 5, details: "<strong>USA (Hybrid / The Pragmatic Leader):</strong> Organizations are moderately hierarchical (the boss makes the final call and is responsible for results), but the communication style is egalitarian (you can challenge the boss with a good, data-driven argument). Leadership is based on individual achievement, confidence, and charisma, not just title." },
        { name: 'Germany', score: 4, details: "<strong>Germany (Hybrid / The Competent Leader):</strong> The structure is clearly hierarchical, and the leader is respected for their deep expertise and competence. However, once in a meeting, a junior expert may be expected to contribute their detailed knowledge directly and factually, as the pursuit of the correct, objective solution (*Sachlichkeit*) can temporarily override the hierarchy." },
        { name: 'UK', score: 3.5, details: "<strong>UK (Hybrid / The Understated Leader):</strong> Hierarchy exists and is often tied to a subtle class system and educational background, but the outward communication style is informal. The boss may be called by their first name, but a clear power distance remains and is understood by all." },
        { name: 'Canada', score: 3, details: "<strong>Canada (Egalitarian / The Coach):</strong> The manager is 'one of the team,' just with a different role. They are accessible, approachable, and informal. First names are used for everyone, including the CEO, to minimize power distance." },
        { name: 'Australia', score: 2.5, details: "<strong>Australia (Egalitarian):</strong> A strong belief that everyone deserves a 'fair go.' Managers are expected to be consultative and down-to-earth. Open and direct communication is valued, regardless of title." },
        { name: 'Netherlands', score: 2, details: "<strong>Netherlands (Egalitarian / The Facilitator):</strong> The boss is a coach or a facilitator whose job is to enable the team to reach a consensus (*polder model*). Decisions can be slow because everyone is consulted, but they have full team buy-in once made." },
        { name: 'Scandinavia', score: 1.5, details: "<strong>Scandinavia (Egalitarian / The Facilitator):</strong> The flattest organizational structures. The boss is a coach whose job is to enable the team to reach a consensus. Open disagreement is normal." },
        { name: 'Israel', score: 1, details: "<strong>Israel (Egalitarian / The Challenger):</strong> A unique culture of directness and comfort with open debate, regardless of hierarchy.

        { name: 'Nigeria', score: 9.5, details: "<strong>Nigeria (Polychronic):</strong> Time is highly flexible. The focus is on the people and the event, not the clock. A start time is often an indicator for the event to begin sometime after." },
        { name: 'Brazil', score: 9, details: "<strong>Brazil (Polychronic):</strong> Time is flexible and relationship-centric. The schedule can and should be bent to accommodate a more important human interaction. A meeting's start time is often an approximation, as the current conversation may take precedence. Interruptions are common and not seen as rude." },
        { name: 'Israel', score: 8.5, details: "<strong>Israel (Polychronic):</strong> Time is fluid and task-oriented. Punctuality is not a high priority; the focus is on achieving the goal, and schedules can be adjusted as needed. Interruptions are common as people focus on the most urgent matter at hand." },
        { name: 'Mexico', score: 8, details: "<strong>Mexico (Polychronic):</strong> Plans are fluid and can change easily. Relationships dictate the schedule. Punctuality is less rigid than in monochronic cultures, but still appreciated in formal business settings." },
        { name: 'Middle East', score: 7.5, details: "<strong>Middle East (Polychronic):</strong> Time is fluid. Appointments may start late as the current relationship-building activity takes priority. Patience is a virtue. The concept of *Inshallah* (God willing) reflects a view that events are not entirely within human control." },
        { name: 'China', score: 6.5, details: "<strong>China (Polychronic/Hybrid):</strong> A complex view. Punctuality for business meetings is extremely important as a sign of respect. However, the overall approach is polychronic and long-term. Deadlines can be seen as flexible, and the Western rush to 'get the deal done' is often used as a negotiation tactic against them. They will take as long as is needed to build the relationship." },

However, the culture is more relaxed than in the US, with a stronger emphasis on work-life balance. Deadlines are taken seriously, but there's an understanding that life outside work is equally important." },

The German team's module passed all unit tests as specified in document 4.1a. The failure is not in our code. The error log, which I have attached, clearly points to a handshake failure with the database API.

Hans, thanks for flagging and for the log file. Very thorough, as always. We'll have a look at the API. It's not immediately obvious what the issue might be, as it was working on the staging server.<br>
