            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1em;">What is a Phrasal Verb?</h3>
            <p>A <strong>phrasal verb</strong> is a common feature of English that combines a <strong>verb with a preposition or an adverb</strong>. This combination creates a new meaning that is often different from the original verb.</p>
            <p>For example, the verb 'look' means to use your eyes. The preposition 'up' means to a higher position. But when you combine them, <strong>'look up'</strong> can mean to search for information. You "look up" a word in the dictionary.</p>
            <p>The key is to learn and treat the phrasal verb as a completely new piece of vocabulary.</p>
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5em;">Examples: Notice how the meaning changes when the verb is combined with a particle:</h4>

                <li><strong>Turn</strong> (to rotate) vs. <strong>Turn down</strong> (to refuse).</li>
                <li><strong>Break</strong> (to separate into pieces) vs. <strong>Break down</strong> (to stop working).</li>
