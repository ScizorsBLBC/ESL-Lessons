Adrian Simancas, 23, was paddling through the icy waters of Patagonia, Chile, when an enormous humpback whale emerged from the deep and engulfed him and his inflatable raft in its mouth. Luckily for Mr Simancas, the esophagus of a humpback can only stretch to a diameter of 40 cm, and is ordinarily the width of a human fist. No sooner had Simancas been gulped up by the humpback than he was spat out into the choppy Southern Ocean. Simancas' father captured the whole horrifying incident on video. He said: \"Suddenly, I saw Adrian emerge from the waves, along with what looked like a gigantic animal.\"\nMr Simancas recounted his terrifying ordeal to journalists back on dry land. He said: \"I felt something hit me from behind. All this happened in a second. Something dark blue or white enveloped me, and a slimy texture brushed my face.\" He continued: \"I started to sink, and I just closed my eyes, expecting an impact\u2026 I was surrounded by water. I realized that I was in something's mouth and I had been eaten.\" He added: \"I felt like I was in a whirlpool\u2026 spinning around.\" The Guardian newspaper reported: \"For a few fleeting moments, Adrian's fate was in the jaws of the 40-ton [mammal].\" Adrian said his close encounter would not deter him from future rafting outings.",

To much fanfare, the much-anticipated Switch 2 console was released last Thursday. It is the follow-up to its hugely popular predecessor, the Switch, which sold 152 million units worldwide. The new console can be used as a portable handheld device or as a tablet. It can be connected to an external display. It comes with two controllers, a power adaptor, a USB-C charging cable, a dock, and two wrist straps. It comes bundled with 25 games, including an enhanced version of the smash success Mario Kart World. Nintendo expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year to March 2026.\nGaming enthusiasts queued for hours outside stores worldwide, clamouring to get their hands on Nintendo's new system. In Japan, the consoles were sold via a national lottery that got around 2.2 million applications. In Tokyo, winners of the draw lined up at dawn outside an electronics store. Switch fan Koji Takahashi, 39, said: \"It's fantastic that players can see each other while playing. I can't wait to go home and play.\" Satoshi Ayame was unsuccessful in the lottery, but undeterred, he went to the store's release event to savour the experience. He said: \"I took a half-day off work because I desperately wanted to try the Switch 2.\" The console has a hefty $449.99 price tag, but fans say it is worth the money.",

Social media is alight with claims the video is racist. The company, American Eagle, produced the video for its new line of clothes. The video stars denim-clad actress Sydney Sweeney. She tells the camera: \"Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour. My jeans are blue.\" The video closes with the tagline: \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\" American Eagle said the play on words was part of its ad campaign's \"provocative language\". It said the words were definitely going to \"push buttons\".\nMany people have criticized the wordplay for having eugenic undertones. Eugenics is a debunked theory that posits that humanity can be improved by encouraging people with certain genes to reproduce, to increase the occurrence of \"desirable\" racial traits. Critics of the ad highlight the fact that Ms Sweeney is white, blue-eyed, and blonde. They suggest her looks are really \"great genes\". Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly called the criticism a \"leftist meltdown\". U.S. Vice President JD Vance called it an overreaction. Meanwhile, the White House communications director said attacking the ad was \"cancel culture run amok\". American Eagle says its ad \"is and always was about the jeans.\"",

The airline could increase the bonus it pays to staff for spotting bags that are too big. Ryanair staff currently get a \"gate bag bonus\" of \u20ac1.50 ($1.75) a passenger. This bonus is capped at about \u20ac80 ($94) a month. Ryanair's chief executive officer (CEO) wants to remove the monthly cap. He hopes removing it will mean fewer large bags going on the aircraft. The CEO said, \"We're already struggling with that amount of baggage. That's one of the reasons we are so aggressive about [cutting] the [number] of passengers with excess baggage.\" Passengers must pay a fee of up to \u20ac75 for oversized bags and suitcases.\nRyanair's CEO said being stricter with baggage was necessary, even though most people follow the rules. He said more than 99.9 per cent of passengers have luggage that fits within the size limits. Ryanair said most people knew about the company's baggage rules because they are clear to see on different websites. The company said: \"Our bag policies and options are well understood, and we remind customers of this when booking, before they travel, and on their boarding pass. A very small proportion of customers who do not [follow our rules] will be charged at the airport.\" The company hopes the problem of oversized luggage will disappear within a few years.",

Any smoker who lights up a cigarette in public will be breaking the law. The new smoking ban is to protect children from passive smoking. This happens when you breathe in smoke from other people who are smoking. The government wants to create a tobacco-free generation by 2032. This means protecting children today.

These are places to play, learn, and breathe; not for smoking.\" She added: \"The freedom to smoke stops where the right of children to breathe clean air begins.\"\nSmoking is slowly falling in France. However, passive smoking still causes up to 5,000 deaths per year. A recent survey showed that 68 per cent of French people support rules to ban smoking in public. They also want bans at outdoor cafes and restaurants, but these places are not included under the new ban. Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable disease, disability and death. It can damage nearly every organ of the body. Smoking near children is especially dangerous because their bodies are still developing. Second-hand smoke can lead to breathing problems and asthma.

The Society of Radiographers (SoR), a medical organization in the UK, said patients are secretly using their phones to film their hospital visits and talks with doctors. The videos are then posted on social media sites. The SoR has called for a ban on video recording in hospitals and clinics. Dean Rogers, director of industrial strategy, said this was a problem that affected many health workers. He said there could also be privacy concerns for other people. He told reporters: \"As healthcare professionals, we need to think: Does that recording breach the confidentiality of other patients?\"\nMedical staff and hospital workers say they are worried about the videos. They do not want to have videos of them uploaded on social media. Ashley d'Aquino, a therapeutic radiographer and union worker, spoke about this problem. She said: \"We had a member of staff who agreed to take photos for a patient, but when the patient handed over her phone, the member of staff saw that the patient had also been [secretly] recording her, to publish on a cancer blog.\" She added: \"We wear name badges, so our names will be visible in any video.

Prior to this ruling, the country's Births and Deaths Registration Act had stipulated that a husband needed to apply to the Home Affairs department in order to take his wife's surname or to hyphenate it. However, even if a man submitted an application, there was no guarantee that it would be granted. The request was denied in many cases. The new decree stipulates that the law prohibiting a man from adopting his spouse's family name was discriminatory on the basis of gender. It says a man has the right to assume the last name of a woman he marries.\nThe court's pronouncement has been met with mixed reaction on social media. Many people lauded the decision as being forward-thinking and a sign that the country was providing greater equality. They highlighted the fact that the previous law was passed in the colonial, apartheid era and was overly paternalistic. They also say the law continues South Africa's progressiveness. The country was the first in Africa to legalize same-sex marriage. However, others have criticized the new ruling. They view it as being counter to the country's traditions.

Citizens of 74 countries now have visa-free access to enter for up to 30 days. In addition, citizens from 54 countries can stay in-transit for 240 hours, but they must have a ticket to a third country. China's government is slowly expanding its visa-free entry process, so it can grow its tourism industry and its economy. It started allowing visitors from more countries in 2023. Almost every European country and many nations from South America, Asia, and the Middle East have been added since then. More than 20 million foreign visitors entered China without a visa in 2024.\nThe number of Chinese tourists at sights in China still greatly outnumbers international tourists. However, the country is preparing for a big increase in the number of overseas travellers. Tour companies are trying to find guides and staff, to help more and more customers. Gao Jun, an English-speaking tour guide with 20 years of experience, is very busy. He said: \"I'm flooded with tours, and I'm struggling to keep up.\" He has started a new business to train new tour guides.

      "Level 6 Text": "Ocean acidification a danger to sharks' teeth\nThe climate crisis may be posing an existential threat to many species of shark. A new study has revealed that the acidification of the world's oceans is causing sharks' teeth to decay. It is well known in the scientific community that increasing ocean acidity is damaging calcified species like corals, molluscs, and sea urchins. This led marine biologists to research whether shark teeth are at similar risk. Lead author of the study, Maximilian Baum, investigated whether \"sharks that swim with their mouths open to ventilate their gills and have constant seawater exposure might also be vulnerable\". He concluded that \"even the teeth of apex predators show visible damage under acidified conditions\".\nBaum and his colleagues analyzed 42 teeth from 10 blacktip reef sharks at an aquarium in Germany. They placed the teeth in two separate water tanks for eight weeks. The salt water in one tank had a pH level of 8.2, which is similar to current ocean averages. The water in the other tank was more acidic, with a pH level of 7.3. Baum found that the teeth in the more acidic water had \"visible surface damage\". This included cracks and cavities, increased root decay, and structural deterioration. He said ongoing damage could impact how sharks feed in the future. Such damage could potentially trigger \"domino effects\" across the health of many marine ecosystems.",

For centuries, volcanologists and seismologists have studied the activity beneath Earth that might indicate an eruption. Forecasting when a volcano might erupt has been somewhat unreliable. However, scientists from NASA and the Smithsonian Institution say they are a step closer to providing more accurate forecasts of when a volcano might blow. NASA used images from space to detect changes in the colour of leaves. The research was based on a 2019 study from McGill University. This study showed that an increase in carbon dioxide levels emitted by two active volcanoes in Costa Rica had an impact on the colour of leaves in the surrounding areas.\nCurrent methods of predicting an imminent volcanic explosion include checking seismic activity, changes in ground height, and carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions. NASA said the new method of monitoring changes in the colour of foliage from space could help in foretelling eruptions. The science behind this is fairly straightforward. As magma moves upwards through Earth's crust, it releases carbon dioxide. Trees absorb this and their leaves become greener and more vibrant. The LiveScience website said: \"These signs can help to protect communities against the worst effects of volcanic blasts, including lava flows, ejected rocks, ashfalls, mudslides, and toxic gas clouds.\"",

Earlier this week, a team of astronomers announced they had detected a chemical that provides the conditions for life forms. Astrophysicist Dr Nikku Madhusudhan from the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy announced the existence of two chemicals called DMS and DMDS. These are \"biosignatures\" \u2013 the potential fingerprints of life. On Earth, these are only produced by microorganisms, such as plankton. The astronomers said the chemicals are \"the most promising signs yet\" of life.\nThe two biosignatures were discovered on a planet called K2-18b. This is about 124 light-years from Earth. One light year is approximately 9.46 trillion km. Dr Madhusudhan speculated that the planet is a Hycean world. This is a potentially habitable planet covered in liquid water with an abundance of hydrogen. He said: \"Given everything we know about [the planet K2-18b], a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have.\" However, he stopped short of stating that life exists on the planet.

This zone is essential to providing the conditions that sustain life. The researchers called the microbes CSP1-3. The microorganisms could be a key part of the process of purifying our water. Microbiologist James Tiedje said that while layers of soil are responsible for much of the filtration of rainwater, CSP1-3 are also indispensable. He said: \"CSP1-3 are the scavengers cleaning up what got through the surface layer of soil.\" They have a job to do to purify our drinking water.\nDr Tiedje and his team focused on the microbes living in the deep soil, up to 200 metres beneath our feet. He said the CSP1-3 microbes remove harmful contaminants and detritus from the water supply. He now wants to cultivate CSP1-3 in his lab to find out more about their properties. He believes they could be utilized to clean up pollution in the soil. He said: \"We don't know their capacities for metabolizing tough pollutants and, if we could learn that, we can help solve one of the Earth's most pressing problems.\" The scitechdaily.com website said: \"Understanding this newly found group could boost conservation efforts and help address climate change.\"",

Proponents of this dietary regimen say it improves metabolism and assists in cellular repair. However, a new long-term study has cast doubt on its merits. Researchers at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China concluded that people who restricted their eating to fewer than eight hours a day faced a 91 per cent higher risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases than those who ate over 12 to 16 hours.\nThe researchers analyzed data from about 20,000 adults over a six-year period. Lead researcher Dr Victor Wenze Zhong said he was taken aback by his findings. He said: \"We were surprised to find that people who followed an eight-hour, time-restricted eating schedule were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease.\" He added: \"Our study's findings encourage a cautious, personalized approach to dietary recommendations, ensuring they are aligned with an individual's health status and the latest scientific evidence.\" The Mayo Clinic observed that fasting has been popular for over 1,500 years.

He said he was only able to harvest 1.5 tons of tencha tea leaves this year, instead of his typical harvest of two tons. He added: \"Last year's summer was so scorching that it damaged the bushes, so we couldn't pluck as many leaves.\"\nMatcha has exploded in popularity, from being a niche product to becoming a trendy flavouring for beverages, smoothies, desserts, and even skincare products. The Global Japanese Tea Association said Japan's tourism boom is exacerbating the green tea shortage. It told the website Sustainability Magazine: \"Many foreigners buy lots of matcha\u2026as souvenirs, sometimes even in bulk.\" It added that this increased appetite for matcha was \"unprecedented,\" and was in part fuelled by social media. Yuki Ishii, founder of the store Tealife, said demand has grown ten-fold, and that he is always out of stock. \"Matcha mania\" has resulted in a scarcity that is also affecting Japan's traditional tea ceremonies.",

She explained how her high-protein diet gave her kidney stones. These are small stones in our urine caused by eating too much high-protein food. They cause pain when peeing. The woman ate only animal-based food in her final year of college. She had two or three eggs and a steak every day. She was shocked when she saw blood in her urine.\nThe carnivore diet is becoming more popular. Many people on social media are promoting it. Some say it raises our energy levels and encourages positive thinking. However, health experts warn that eating too much meat, fish and dairy products is bad for us. This is because there is not enough fibre in the diet. This can lead to health problems and heart disease. The woman told people not to eat too much protein.

At the same time, people are living longer. Falling birth rates and increased longevity are creating many problems. Smaller numbers of workers are having to pay the pensions of older people who have retired. Dr Natalia Kanem, executive director of UNFPA, said: \"Many countries are [struggling] with ageing and shrinking populations, labour shortages, and rising healthcare and pension costs. These are real concerns.\"\nThe United Nations surveyed over 14,000 people in 14 countries on five continents to make its report. One of the key findings was of the global fertility crisis. The UN said the high cost of parenthood is the biggest reason for women not having children. Many couples want children, but they cannot afford them. Nearly 20 per cent of adults believe they will not be able to have the number of children they want. There were other reasons for falling birth rates. These include low salaries, expensive housing, and worries about the future of our world. The UN said one solution to the crisis is to create \"family-friendly policies, such as affordable childcare and paid leave for all carers\".",

He wanted a photo of himself in front of a portrait by the Italian painter Anton Domenico Gabbiani, who died in 1726. The man lost his balance and fell backwards. When he tried to stop himself from falling, he put his hand through the bottom of the painting. Museum staff reported him to the police for causing damage to the priceless artwork. Experts are now repairing the painting. They say that luckily, there was not a lot of damage.\nThe tourist's careless action has angered many people in Italy. Simone Verde, the director of the Uffizi Gallery, told the UK's \"Telegraph\" newspaper that selfies are becoming a headache. He said: \"The problem of visitors coming to museums to create memes or take selfies for social media is now out of control. We put in place very precise rules to try to stop behaviour that is not compatible with respect for our cultural heritage.\" Vanessa Carlon, director of Italy's Palazzo Maffei Museum, commented on a similar incident that happened in her gallery.

President Nayib Bukele has appointed a former army captain, Karla Trigueros, as education minister. She has started inspecting schools wearing army fatigues. Ms Trigueros is also a physician and was head of the country's vaccination logistics during the coronavirus pandemic. One of her first edicts was to require all school principals to become role models. School heads will be required to greet students as they come through the school gates each morning. They will also scrutinize pupils' haircuts and uniforms. Trigueros warned schools that: \"Failure to comply with these provisions…will be considered a serious breach of administrative responsibility.\"\nThe main focus of El Salvador's new education initiative is on appearance and conduct. In particular, boys are required to have closely-cropped, military-style haircuts, while all students must wear tidy uniforms and greet all teachers respectfully. There has been mixed reaction to the new policy. A leading teachers' union called it a \"regrettable militarization\" of schools. It was concerned that the country was veering back to the days of military dictatorship. It said: \"We are concerned that the already [endemic] abuses of power against students will increase.\" However, many parents are supportive of the new rules.

Netflix said the show brings \"critical early learning to children throughout the country for free\". Education was a key reason why Sesame Street was created. In the late 1960s, psychologist Lloyd Morrisett and TV producer Joan Ganz Cooney thought of the idea of the show. They worked with Harvard University's School of Education to think of a new way to teach America's pre-school children. Since 1969, Sesame Street has taught basic maths, literacy, and social skills to children worldwide. It also encouraged tolerance and diversity.",

Pakistan vociferously denied the allegations. Both countries have launched military strikes on each other since the attack. Pakistan said it targeted military sites in India after India fired missiles at air bases in Pakistan's Punjab province on Saturday. This fuelled fears that tensions might escalate into a more dangerous regional conflict.\nThe ceasefire is looking somewhat fragile as both sides are accusing each other of violating it. Pakistan's foreign ministry said the country \"remains committed to a faithful implementation of the ceasefire\". A spokesman for India's military denied accusations that India was not adhering to the truce. He said India would retaliate if its territory was attacked. He warned: \"We remain fully operationally ready to launch whatever operations may be required in defence of the nation\".

Scientists will use this DNA to modify the genome of an emu, which is the closest living relative of the moa.\nColossal is embarking on many \"de-extinction\" projects. These have created controversy among the scientific community. Colossal defines de-extinction as: \"The process of generating an organism that both resembles and is genetically similar to an extinct species.\" It claims de-extinction will allow scientists to engineer natural resistances in endangered animals today. It would also enhance the adaptability of species to \"thrive\" amid climate change, dwindling resources, disease and human interference. However, critics contend that extinct animals cannot be replicated. Many scientists are concerned about the unforeseen and detrimental impacts of inserting \"hybrid\" species into the wild.",

A new study into the state of being happy shows that our contentment depends on the interaction of a wide variety of factors. Emorie Beck, assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, led an investigation into what makes us happy. Understanding this could help mental health professionals to provide better treatments for people struggling with depression and anxiety. Professor Beck wrote: \"We have to understand the sources of happiness to build effective interventions.\" Her study has been published in the journal \"Nature Human Behaviour\".\nProfessor Beck suggested that happiness can come from external circumstances (like income, job satisfaction, and possessions) or internal feelings. Beck wrote about three models of happiness. The first is the \"bottom-up\" frame of mind. This is based on our overall satisfaction with factors like wealth, jobs and relationships. This framework is the one used for the World Happiness Report. The second model is a \"top-down\" perspective. This suggests happiness comes from internal attitudes towards life. People can control this through things like meditation or therapy. The final model is a bidirectional one. This is where the bottom-up and top-down models interact to create happiness.",

However, some people claim they can remember things that happened in the first year of their lives. Researchers at Yale and Columbia University in the United States studied why people have no recollection of things that happened in the first four or five years of their lives. The research team also investigated whether or not babies formed memories at all. Researcher Dr Tristan Yates suggested we may not be able to remember being a baby. He said: \"Our results suggest that babies' brains have the capacity for forming memories, but how long-lasting these memories are is still an open question.\"\nThe research has been published in the journal \"Science\". It suggests that babies as young as a year old can form and store memories. Researchers used a specially designed scanner to observe activity in an area of babies' brains called the hippocampus. This is where memories are created and stored. The research found that babies can form limited types of memories from the age of two months. It is possible that infants can detect patterns in people's faces, language and in daily routines. However, episodic memory, which allows us to recall specific events, may take longer to form. The researchers say this kind of memory may not occur until the hippocampus has more fully matured.",

A tourism official said the peaks that will have no climbing fees are between 5,970 metres and 7,132 metres high. The director of Nepal's Tourism Department told The Kathmandu Post about the new plan. He said: \"Despite their breathtaking beauty, the number of tourists and mountaineers here is very low as access is so difficult.\" He hoped the plan would \"create jobs, generate income, and strengthen the local economy\".\nNepal's government also announced a change in the fee it charges to climb Mount Everest, the world\u2019s highest mountain. From the 1st of September, the cost of climbing Everest will rise from $11,000 to $15,000. This is the first increase in nearly ten years. Other popular peaks will also have higher fees. An additional rule to climb Everest was introduced earlier this year. Trekkers now need to prove they have scaled a peak in Nepal that is over 7,000 metres high. The government hopes this will encourage more people to attempt some of the 97 free mountains.

Research published in the journal \"Frontiers in Psychology\" found that people with a severe lactose intolerance were more prone to bad dreams and insomnia. Professor Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Dream and Nightmare Lab in Montreal, Canada, analyzed the diet, health, and sleep patterns of more than 1,000 people. She wanted to investigate the degree to which food affected dreams. She based her research on a 2015 study that looked into \"food-dependent dreaming\". Participants in the 2015 study blamed cheese and other dairy products for disturbing their sleep.\nDr St-Onge discovered that people with gastrointestinal problems and lactose intolerance had scarier and more frequent nightmares. She said: \"If you have gastrointestinal issues, that could account for a lot of what's happening in terms of sleep disturbances that could be associated with different dreams.\" Her colleague, Dr Tore Nielsen, said: \"Sleep disturbances affect a huge proportion of the general population. One large survey found that 30-40 per cent of individuals will have a clinically significant sleep disorder in their lifetime.\" Previous research suggests that about 85 per cent of adults have a nightmare at least once a year, with about 5 per cent of people experiencing them frequently.",

These will not be exhibited as part of the zoo's collection. Instead, they will become food for the resident big cats and other predators. The zoo is attempting \"to imitate the natural food chain of the animals\". It added that using the unwanted small creatures as food is practical because \"nothing goes to waste, and we ensure the natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators\". It reassured people that the donated pets will be \"gently euthanized\" before being fed to other animals.\nThe zoo said that the practice of putting down animals to be used as feed was common in Denmark. Pia Nielsen, deputy director of the zoo, said: \"Many of our guests and partners appreciate the opportunity to contribute.\" Regardless, there has been mixed reaction on social media. Some people felt sad about the euthanasia scheme, and wanted to protest. However, a man who donated a horse to the zoo was satisfied with its treatment. He said his animal was put down \"in the most peaceful and calm way\". There is so much interest in helping the zoo that there are waiting lists to donate horses.

North Sentinel is a protected area and home to the Sentinelese people, an indigenous tribe who have fiercely defended their isolation from the outside world. The tourist made the prohibited journey to the island. He did not make contact with the islanders, but he did leave them a can of Diet Coke and a coconut. He could face up to five years in prison.\nThe Indian government has barred outsiders from visiting North Sentinel Island. This is to protect the unique Sentinelese way of life. It is also to shield the inhabitants from modern illnesses. A spokeswoman for a non-profit group that protects isolated tribes said: \"It's very well known that uncontacted peoples have no immunity to common outside diseases like flu or measles, which could completely wipe them out.\" Survival International said the Sentinelese are \"the most isolated indigenous people in the world.\" In the past few decades, the islanders have killed several people who have attempted to visit the island.

This is also a concern in many other countries. The group did not indicate to what degree these facilities are contributing to drought conditions in many parts of the UK. It is estimated that the centres use up to 10 billion litres of water per year to cool their giant facilities. One water company reported that a large data centre can use as much water as 50,000 households. Despite concerns from environmentalists, the UK is pushing ahead to build many more data centres. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said they were essential for economic growth.\nThe NDG has urged Britons to take measures to cut back on their water consumption. One such measure is to trash unwanted emails and large images. The group claims this will lessen the demand for water. A government website suggested deleting old emails and pictures \"as data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems\". NDG chairperson Helen Wakeham said a simple everyday action such as tidying up one's inbox and spam and trash folders will \"really help the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife\".

Researchers from the University of Kent in the UK believe the lunar soil is good enough for tea plants to grow in. Lead researcher Professor Nigel Mason said: \"We are at the very earliest stages of research into space agriculture.\" He added: \"It is reassuring that we may be able to provide access to the great British tradition of a tea break.\" This is good news for astronauts who visit the Moon in the future. They will be able to have a cup of Moon-grown tea. It could also be good news for farmers who struggle to grow crops in poor soil. Researchers hope farmers worldwide will be able to farm even in poor soil.\n\nProfessor Mason and his team investigated whether tea plants could grow in lunar and Martian soil. He said: \"Our experiments reveal that…plants such as tea may be cultivated in lunar soil within lunar greenhouses, allowing inhabitants of such bases some degree of [independence] and access to fresh food.\" The researchers planted tea in a special soil they made that is close to the type of soil found on the Moon and on Mars. Fellow researcher Dr Sara Lopez-Gomollon was happy with her findings.

      "Level 6 Text": "The workplace phenomenon of \"revenge quitting\" is growing worldwide, fuelled by social media. Revenge quitting is when an employee purposely causes disruption in or attacks the reputation of an employer. It is on the rise in Gen Z workers, who are making it a viral trend. Disgruntled employees are posting details of their resignations online. Other posts show workers suddenly walking off the job, viral resignation messages, or venting frustrations with rants against former bosses. Other vengeful acts include causing problems for former co-workers. Examples of this are deleting data and files, not helping with the handover of duties, and exposing sensitive information.\n\nThe employer-rating website Glassdoor has warned of \"a wave of revenge quitting\" because of rising dissatisfaction among employees. The UK recruitment company Reed surveyed 2,008 workers and found that 15 per cent of British employees had \"revenge quit\" their jobs. Reed said Gen Z workers were more likely to engage in revenge quitting. Their survey found that 26 per cent of 18- to 34-year-olds had done so, compared with 8 per cent of people aged 45 and older. A survey in Japan conducted by management consulting firm Scholar Consult Co. found that around 10 per cent of workers in Japan had been troubled by revenge quitters because of a sudden increase in workloads.",

It stands at a lofty height of 625 metres above the Beipan River. The feat of engineering also has the longest span of any bridge that has been constructed in rugged terrain. The bridge is 2,890 metres long, with the main span stretching 1,420 metres. The crossing will have a significant impact on the economy, logistics, and travel times in the region. It will slash the travel time between the two sides of the Beipan River from two hours to just two minutes. A spokesperson said it would revitalize rural areas.\n\nChina is displaying an impressive level of prowess in bridge-building. The website highestbridges.com lists the 18 tallest bridges in the world, all of which have been constructed or are under construction in China. The top three are in Guizhou, which also boasts a further 32,000 spans. Nearly half of the 100 highest bridges in the world are located there. The Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge is also full of cutting-edge engineering features in its wind-resistant design and high-altitude construction. The spokesperson expects the bridge will become a sightseeing spot and attract more than a million visitors a year. It has a cafe, a geological museum, and a bungee-jumping centre.",
