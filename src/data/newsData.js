      "Image URL": "",
      "Level 0 Text": "Scientists are trying to grow tea on the Moon. They think it is possible. It will be hard. Tea needs water and sun. The Moon has no air. The tea will be in a special box. This box will have air and water.",
      "Level 0 Questions": "1. What do scientists want to grow on the Moon?\n2. What does tea need to grow?\n3. Where will the tea be?",
      "Level 1 Text": "Scientists have a new plan to grow tea on the Moon. They believe it is possible, but it will be a big challenge. Tea plants need specific conditions like water, sunlight, and air, which the Moon does not have. The plants will grow inside a special, sealed container that can create an Earth-like environment.",
      "Level 1 Questions": "1. What is the scientists' new plan?\n2. What three things do tea plants need?\n3. What will the special container do?",
      "Level 2 Text": "In an ambitious new project, scientists are exploring the possibility of cultivating tea plants on the Moon. While a significant challenge, they are confident it can be done. The primary obstacle is the Moon's hostile environment, which lacks the atmosphere, water, and soil necessary for tea to grow. To overcome this, the plants will be housed in a sophisticated biosphere, a sealed container designed to replicate Earth's growing conditions.",
      "Level 2 Questions": "1. What does it mean to 'cultivate' tea plants?\n2. What is the 'primary obstacle' to growing tea on the Moon?\n3. What is a 'biosphere' in this context?",
      "Level 3 Text": "In a groundbreaking initiative, researchers are proposing the cultivation of tea plants on the lunar surface. Despite the considerable challenges, the project is considered feasible. The most significant hurdle is the Moon's inhospitable environment, which is devoid of the essential elements for agriculture. The proposed solution involves utilizing a self-contained biosphereâ€”an advanced, sealed habitat engineered to meticulously replicate terrestrial conditions for the plants.",
      "Level 3 Questions": "1. What does 'groundbreaking initiative' mean?\n2. How would you describe an 'inhospitable environment'?\n3. What does it mean to 'meticulously replicate' something?"

The diamond's discovery was quite unusual; it was found by a young girl in a pile of rubble in her uncle's backyard in the 1980s.",
      "Level 2 Questions": "1. What does 'internally flawless' mean?\n2. What does it mean to 'fetch' a certain price at an auction?\n3. What was 'unusual' about the diamond's discovery?",
      "Level 3 Text": "The 'Golden Canary,' a historically significant and internally flawless diamond, is headlining an upcoming auction. The pear-shaped, fancy deep brownish-yellow diamond is projected to sell for an estimated $20 million. It is one of the most substantial cut diamonds in existence. Its provenance is equally remarkable, having been serendipitously discovered by a young girl in a pile of rubble in the 1980s.",

        "Image URL": "",
        "Level 0 Text": "Giraffes are in trouble. There are not many left. They are now on a list of endangered animals. The number of giraffes has gone down by 40 per cent. This is very sad. People are building on the land where giraffes live. We need to help save them.",
        "Level 0 Questions": "1. What animal is in trouble?\n2. How much has the number of giraffes gone down by?\n3. Why are giraffes in trouble?",
        "Level 1 Text": "Giraffes have been added to the list of endangered species for the first time. The population of the world's tallest land animal has decreased by 40 per cent in the past 30 years. The main reasons for this decline are loss of habitat and illegal hunting. Conservation groups are calling for more action to protect giraffes.",
        "Level 1 Questions": "1. What list have giraffes been added to?\n2. What is the percentage decrease in the giraffe population?\n3. What are the two main reasons for this decline?",
        "Level 2 Text": "For the first time, giraffes have been officially classified as 'vulnerable' on the endangered species list. The population of these iconic animals has plummeted by 40 per cent over the last three decades. Experts attribute this drastic decline to habitat fragmentation and poaching. Conservationists are now urging governments to implement stronger protective measures.",
        "Level 2 Questions": "1. What does 'vulnerable' mean in this context?\n2. What does it mean if a population has 'plummeted'?\n3. What is 'habitat fragmentation'?",
        "Level 3 Text": "Giraffes have undergone a 'silent extinction,' leading to their recent classification as a vulnerable species. The global population has experienced a precipitous 40 per cent decline in just three decades. This is primarily attributed to anthropogenic pressures, including habitat fragmentation and rampant poaching. Consequently, conservation bodies are advocating for immediate and robust international intervention to safeguard their future.",
