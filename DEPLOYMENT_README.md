## 📅 Testing Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment (Day 1)
- Deploy to test-esl-lessons.scizors.wtf
- Basic functionality verification
- Critical bug fixes only

### Phase 2: Feature Validation (Days 2-3)
- Test all interactive components
- Validate accessibility features
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Security Audit (Days 4-5)
- API security verification
- Error handling validation
- Production readiness check

### Phase 4: User Testing (Days 6-7)
- Real user feedback collection
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation

### Phase 5: Production Decision (Day 8)
- Final review and approval
- Migration to main branch if successful
- Rollback plan if issues found

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Address)
- API key security (critical - blocks deployment)
- Core functionality breakage (critical - blocks deployment)
- Performance degradation (high - affects UX)

### Medium Risk (Should Address)
- Accessibility issues (medium - compliance requirement)
- Cross-browser compatibility (medium - user experience)
- Mobile responsiveness (medium - usage patterns)

### Low Risk (Monitor)
- Minor UI inconsistencies (low - cosmetic)
- Advanced feature edge cases (low - nice-to-have)
- Documentation completeness (low - internal)

## 📊 Migration Decision Matrix

### GO (Migrate to Production)
- ✅ All must-have criteria met
- ✅ Security requirements satisfied
- ✅ Core functionality working
- ✅ Performance acceptable
- ✅ User feedback positive

### HOLD (Continue Testing)
- ⚠️ Critical security issues
- ⚠️ Core functionality broken
- ⚠️ Performance unacceptable
- ⚠️ Major accessibility violations

### ROLLBACK (Abandon Migration)
- ❌ Critical security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Complete functionality failure
- ❌ Unacceptable performance degradation
- ❌ Major compliance violations

## 🎯 Final Decision Point

Migration to production will occur when:
1. All must-have criteria are satisfied
2. Security audit passes
3. Performance meets standards
4. User acceptance testing completes successfully
5. Risk assessment shows acceptable risk level
